<h1>Casey L. Schmid's New Media Art Portfolio</h1>

<p>Hello everybody! My name is Casey L. Schmid and I have made this portfolio for my ART 74 Class at San Jos√© State University (I'm a Studio Practice Undergraduate student, by the way).I hope that you find the new media art I have made on this site to be fascinating, and that it will inspire to dig deeper into new media art and maybe experiment with it yourself. Have fun exploring, and check out the collage below!<p>

<h2>Consumer Collage</h2>

<img src="images/consumercollage.jpg" alt="collage" width="720" height=600" class="rounded img-fluid" >

<p>While this is a project that I made in my Creative Arts 172 (Arts in US Society) class, I felt like it matched with the overall theme of my website since it was made digitally in photoshop. This collage is about my consumer lifestyle.</p>

</p>For thus collage, I went for something that is meant to be visually appealing, while at the same time illustrating my lifestyle as a consumer. I decided to give the layout a balance between proper organization and fun chaos (randomly placing where they can still be easily found). While I am not as much of a consumer as some other people in this class, I do still consume necessities for classes, such as notebooks, online resources and tools, writing utensils, books, and papers for writing if necessary, with my mom or dad's help. Others, most of the things that I would purchase as a consumer (once I gain true financial independence of course) include art supplies, clothing, and books about subjects I love, come from stores like Barns & Noble and Micheals, though I rarely go shopping in order to help myself save up on money for future endeavors (including consumption).</p>

</p>Sometimes, I do consume food from Great Bear Coffee (this a coffee place in Los Gatos I recommend you check out. Their food is fantastic!), which I purchase using cash or a debit card (I make sure not to do it too often so to save money). Sometimes I also consumer apps from the App Store, such as games or social media on my electronics (namely my phone), but I only stick to consuming apps that can be downloaded for free (only requiring my password for me to purchase it). However, I have started making my own money, by way of converting my artwork onto note cards to be sold at markets or to personal friends via Venmo or Bank of America. This helps me to make money which is kept safe in my accounts for future needs (such as buying home or for retirement).</p>

</p>In short, my consumer lifestyle is one who consumes independently only once in a while, while I get help buying and selling consumer products as necessary with the help of friends and family, who want me to develop the needed building blocks to gain true financial independence when the time is right. Hope you enjoy!.</p>
