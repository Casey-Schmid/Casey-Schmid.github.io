<h1>This is a Cat</h1>

<p>A cat is a small carnivorous animal that is a member of the animal family called felidae. Typically kept domesticated as pets and farm cats, some can also be feral cats who prefer to avoid human contact. Cats are known for their retractable claws to kill small prey, strong sense of flexibility and reflexes, well-developed sense of smell, night vision, and high intelligence. Their methods of communication include purring, meowing, hissing growling, and a wide array of body language (such as lying down when tired and intense eye contact when concentrating on prey). The second most popular pet in the United States after dogs, roughly 73.8 million cats lived in approximately 42.2 million household in 2024.</p>
