<h1>Casey L. Schmid's New Media Art Portfolio</h1>

<img src="images/mashup.jpg" alt="mashup" width="650" height=450" class="rounded img-fluid">

<p>This is what we call a "meme mashup." This is a type of meme or new/digital media art created by mixing different images or other content together (often from different forms of media or photos from real life) to create something that has a specific message or theme,  or which is otherwise made for some good laughs.<p>

<p>For my meme mashup, which was also made in February 2025, I created a meme mashup in Adobe Photoshop to represent how getting super drink can cause people to hallucinate. Joey Tribbiani from Friends (1994 - 2004) is drinking in a New York City Bar and hallucinated seeing Detective Pikachu from Pokemon; Detective Pikachu (2019), and realizing he has had too much to drink. This signifies the importance of warning people against drinking too much, not just regarding harmful consequences such as DUIs and car wrecks, but also hallucination-induced freak outs.</p>
