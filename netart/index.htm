<h1>This is Art</h1>

<p>Art is a special talent among mankind that spans across its entire history. There are various forms of art, and they include studio Art (drawing, painting, sculptures, watercolor, pastels, or even digital art), music (singing, songwriting, playing instruments, musical compositions, and scoring), performance (singing, acting for stage and screen, or dancing), literary art (writing books, novels, poems, or memoirs), culinary arts (cooking or baking), and film/Television (writing, directing, producing, editing, or cinematography). The arts relies on creativity and imagination to bring a wide variety of ideas to life, often times containing special messages or lesson pertaining to themes such as mortality, morality, humanity, nature, politics, psychology, the human anatomy, spirituality, one's sense of self, a personal narrative, or even something the artist likes.</p>
