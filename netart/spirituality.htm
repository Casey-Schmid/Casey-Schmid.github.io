<h1>This is Spirituality</h1>

<p>Spirituality is a very interesting, yet relatively complex concept. In its basic form, spirituality is the sense of connection to something greater than oneself, such as art, nature, or even a higher power. It also involves searching for one's meaning and purpose in life and involves a feeling of life and transcendence (between the physical and spiritual). It is also based around a set of values that guides one's thoughts and actions in life, as well as connection to others, both inner and outer. The practices in spirituality include yoga, meditation, prayer, and unplugging from technology to connect with nature. The benefits of spirituality include developing feelings of peace and mindfulness to better connect with the world around us, as well as an ability to remain rooted in the present moment. .</p>
