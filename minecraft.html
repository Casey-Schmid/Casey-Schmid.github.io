<h1>Minecraft Art</h1>

<p>Sometimes, new/digital media art can be made using online games, one of the most popular of these being Minecraft (2011). In this game, players navigate a world made entirely of blocks and either play survival stories in survival or let their imaginations run wild in creative mode.<p>

<h2>Minecraft Sculpture</h2>

<p>For creative mode, in March 2025, I made this sculpture of the famous Pixar Ball. I chose this object because I have grown up with Pixar, which is a big part of my life, especially with the gorgeous animation and poignant themes of their movies. The Pixar ball, particular, with its iconic primary color palette and simplistic design. is one of the biggest pop culture icons in recent animated history. I hope to have this ball one day to showcase my strong appreciation for Pixar as a whole.</p>

<h2>Minecraft Base</h2>

<p>The other image you see is off a survival base I made while playing survival mode. This is just to give players an idea of what it is like to play survival mode and how they can build a sturdy base as needed.</p>
